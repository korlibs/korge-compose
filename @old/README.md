# korge-compose
KorGE &lt;-> JetPack Compose experiments

Exploration repository to answer some questions and figure out what can we achieve:

* Using `@Composable` custom applier <https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/Applier> to use Composable code inside KorGE
* Can we run a normal compose for desktop app by using KorIM/KorGW/KorGE as renderer instead of Skia?
* Can we place KorGE components inside existing compose apps? ie. Compose for Android, Desktop and/or JS. ie. Create a `@Composable` component with a KorGE app inside.
